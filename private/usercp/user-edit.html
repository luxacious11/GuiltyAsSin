              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Wing Manifestation&lt;/div&gt;
              Nik has huge white-feathered wings that he can hide and show on command. They are large enough to allow for flight and, when he doesn't want them around anymore, they fall away into piles of feathers as if they were never there.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Immortality&lt;/div&gt;
              Although not completely impervious to injury, Nik is unable to die and his body has also stopped aging. It allows him to live without illness and survive injuries that most never would. This kicked in when he died at around thirty years old, thus why he still looks that age.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Clairvoyance&lt;/div&gt;
              Nik has a heightened sense of perception through his clairvoyance. He is unaware of this ability, beyond the fact that he tends to know when people are close even if they don't make a sound. It doesn't really extend beyond this and the occasional, general gut feeling about a situation.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Electrical Creation &amp; Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              Nik is capable of creating and manipulating electricity. This is one of the powers he &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; he has, meaning he is very well-practiced with it.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Hope Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              Nik is capable of increasing someone's hope, or giving them hope when they are hopeless. He is entirely unaware of this ability and so it is almost constantly active.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Soul Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              
              Along with manipulating hope, Nik can also manipulate souls. Specifically, Nik is capable of healing souls from damage, or making them impervious to it. Leaving a soul impervious to damage results in the person becoming immortal. He is entirely unaware of this ability as well.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Storm Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              Lastly, he is capable of manipulating rain and thunderstorms. This ability is heavily tied to his emotions and, on top of that, he is unaware of its existence, like many of his other abilities. He is capable of creating violent storms of the aforementioned nature, or of quelling them completely.</textarea></td>

              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Wing Manifestation&lt;/div&gt;
              The wings themselves are obviously large and cumbersome to enable flight, but what he finds most annoying about them is that every time he hides them he has to clean up huge piles of feathers, as the wings quite literally 'fall away'.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Immortality&lt;/div&gt;
              Although he comes back from death every time he is fatally injured, he doesn't heal any faster than the average person. The only time his injuries heal almost instantly is if he's died and come back to life. It is also incredibly painful to come back from death, making it an altogether unpleasant experience. Additionally, he is very adamant that not aging is overrated and a hassle, much like his wings.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Clairvoyance&lt;/div&gt;
              His clairvoyance isn't particularly detailed, so it's mostly useless. It does help him get a general sense on if he can trust someone or not, whether he's alone or not, and so on - but nothing more. He doesn't get straight up visions or clear pictures. It's like a very strong sense of intuition.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Electricity Creation &amp; Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              Initially, this ability was very attached to his emotions. With decades of practice, it isn't anymore, but extreme emotions may still cause a bit of a reaction in the form of sparking fingers.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Hope Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              In order to give people hope, Nik must first give up some of his own. He cannot outright manipulate levels of hope, only transfer it from himself to another human being. In theory, he could transfer it between people without involving himself, but he would have to be aware of his abilities to do that.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Soul Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              Although he can do a great many things with this ability, he is unable to damage a soul in any way. Additionally, it leaves him exhausted and vulnerable - his own immortality is sapped away for the duration of the process until such a time as he has recovered fully from it.
              
              &lt;div class="h6"&gt;Storm Manipulation&lt;/div&gt;
              He is incapable of affecting any storms other than rain and thunder/lightning storms. As they are tied to his emotions, a rough day can result in a terrible storm, and a good day usually has clear skies around him.</textarea></td>

He still gets stiff and sore in his shoulder and ankle to this day.
              + No matter the weather, he will be wearing long-sleeved shirts to cover the scars. He remains ashamed of them and uncomfortable discussing his history, especially in regards to them.
              + Started with a degree in electrical engineering in his youth, leading to code-breaking assistance during the Second World War. However, after this, he floundered a little and found little joy in his original field of study, so he has gone on to get a couple different undergraduate degrees, including computer sciences, music, psychology, and literature.
              + Nothing stuck, so he's generally unemployed and simply tinkering with his own personal projects now. He's happier that way. Albeit, also more lonely.
              + Much like his studies, he's also been picking up a variety of languages over the years. His mother tongue is Serbian, but he is fluent in Croatian, English, French, and Italian; conversational in Russian, German, and Spanish; and he is contemplating picking up something else now. He also has some classical Latin training, though he wouldn't dare proclaim himself an expert.
              + After the storm when he was younger, he's been wary of thunder and lightning since. He has his coping mechanisms, but you're never going to find him outside in a storm unless he absolutely has to be - and the more he can drown out the sound and sight of it, the better. For everyone, in fact, given his panic during it tends to make the storm worse - not that he's put two and two together yet.
              + He never quite figured out what his actual ability was and maintains, to this day, he has wings, electricity, and immortality. He's always deemed it a strange combination, but he hasn't looked too much into it.
              + He's picked up a fair few self-soothing hobbies over the years, but the most obvious are the piano and the fact he stress-bakes.... a lot. 
              + He has a deep affinity for high places and feeling the wind in his face. The fact he can fly and cannot die both help encourage him taking stupid risks to chase down this high, and it isn't uncommon to see him at the very edge of a cliff or atop some of the skyscrapers in Limbo.
              + He's a hell of an insomniac and a workaholic, even if he doesn't actually hold down a proper job. He has gone days without sleeping in more than fifteen minute naps, and he's done it frequently. If he could die, it might well have killed him by now.
              + He also has an eidetic memory which, while it has helped with all of the above academic endeavours... it also makes it extremely difficult to forget what he's been through and what he's done. Parts of his life have been haunting enough as it is; he doesn't need the reminders.

              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;having been deserted or cast off&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are two hours old when you are found on the doorstep of the church. The priest's wife had forgotten something after the Friday evening service and had run back to get it, only to find you and forget all about the scarf sitting in the pews. You weren't swaddled in anything and, although it was summer, it was still cold for a little babe as small as you were, and so she clutched you to her chest to keep you warm and brought you home. There was no doctor in your home town. In fact, there were less than five hundred people — none of which were your mother, no less, as none of the women were pregnant and then not. The lady had looked and looked for two weeks, caring for you and laying you to sleep in the crib her son had outgrown a few years prior. Eventually, her husband simply told her to stop. That you would be theirs, a brother to Danilo.
              
              That was your first word, too — your brother's name. Or, at least, an attempt at it. It came out more like "an-ee", but it was something and you swear that, in the back of your too-full mind, you can still see Dani's little grin and how he would jump with excitement whenever you spoke to him or about him, or whenever you reached for him. He always loved being your brother. Was made for it, you might say. He was gentle and loving and good. But he was too good, and nothing too good ever stayed in your life. Why would it? You were always destined to leave disaster in your wake. You should have been forgotten on that rural church doorstep and picked up by wolves. It would have been easier for everyone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;alone&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;having no one else present; on one's own&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are five years old (five years, ten hours, three minutes, to be exact) when it becomes clear to your tiny child's mind that you are not meant for good things. It is your birthday and your mother is baking some baklava for you, your dad is whittling away to try and frantically finish a beautiful carving of galloping horses for over-top your bed, and Danilo is determined to take you out for a trail ride. You don't ride the family horse alone yet, except at a walk with someone leading her, but he tosses you up into the saddle and then climbs up after you, wrapping an arm firmly around your waist. He isn't large, not really, but to you, he's practically an adult, a good five years, eight months, three days, and twenty-two hours older than you. It doesn't help that he is tall and lanky, while you are still short, even if you don't really have any baby fat anywhere but your cheeks. It doesn't matter, though, because he is your favourite person in the whole world and he's determined to make today the best day ever for you, as he is every birthday.
              
              It had rained the night before, so the ground is wet, the dirt turned to mud, and the grass slick under the mare's feet. You remember each vivid detail, can relive it in your own personal movie theatre in your head whenever you wish and often even when you don't. You have only ever seen this gift as a curse, but not because of that specific moment — rather, for every moment that comes after it, beginning with the long stretch that you've seen Dani gallop the mare down more often than not. You beg him, pretty please, let her go faster. You are happy, but a walk is boring and you don't need Dani with you to stay on at a walk. You peer up at him with your big eyes and a little pout and even though he knows it's not a good idea with the footing, he doesn't say a word to you, grins back, and gives the mare a kick to push her to a trot. Before long, you're cantering across the field, grinning and giggling and nearly bouncing right out of the saddle, only held in place by Dani's arm securely around your waist.
              
              And then the mare slips. The whole world turns to slow motion and you fly through the air, Dani flying further and soaring right over you. You hear a crack, but you don't register what that crack is as you hit the ground with a thud. You are scared and bruised but barely hurt, just having a little trouble breathing, so you scramble to your feet to try and catch the mare (dad will kill you if you lose her) and you manage in time to slip yourself, the dragging reins catching around your throat as she panics and bolts. You are pulled free by a rock that lodges in your side, but you are too desperate for air to feel the pain. The rock comes dislodged, stuck more firmly in the ground than it is in you, when you stand, whimpering instantly as the pain sets in, but you stumble to Dani's body all the same where it lies in the grass, unmoving. His head is next to another rock, but you don't see the red of the blood, instead collapsing next to him. You shake him and scream at him and cry. You keep going until you pass out and you wake up without a voice from all the screams. You are in your bed, laceration stitched and covered, and on the road to recovery. Dani, on the other hand, is in the ground underneath a crooked tombstone.
              
              Your mind latches onto the idea that you killed your brother, and it never quite lets loose of that guilt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;forsaken&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;abandoned or deserted; cast aside&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are six and you haven't seen your mother — no, not your mother, &lt;i&gt;Anica&lt;/i&gt; — in a few months. You have suffered through harsh words from Luka (your 'father'). You aren't sure how many to believe, but you believe him when he says you are not theirs. You are just a charity case, sent by God to test their faith as you destroy their family. Anica has locked herself away in the bedroom, refusing to see anyone most days and, while Luka will enter anyway, he doesn't allow you in. You don't deserve to see her, he says. Instead, you look after little Marica. She was only a few months old when Danilo died, so she'll never remember him, but you are determined to be the same sort of brother to her that Dani was to you, even if you aren't her brother at all. She smiles and laughs when she sees you — she laughs a lot and it is the only thing you live for — so you figure you must be doing something right.
              
              Of course, when her first word was &lt;i&gt;'ik'&lt;/i&gt; for Nikolas, that was the first day you felt the sting of a hand across your face, so not everything associated with her is good. But you try to make it all okay anyway.
              
              You are only eight when you first feel the burn of a cigarette on your skin. You scream and cry at the pain, so you are forced to endure another, and another, and another, until you suffer through it in silence, tears streaming down your face, but your teeth gritted to keep them closed. &lt;i&gt;'You don't want to wake Mari,'&lt;/i&gt; Luka whispers in your ear. You know then that it will not be the last time, but that you must be quiet or it will be worse. You duck your head to avoid his eyes, glossed over with the stupor of whiskey, and murmur a soft &lt;i&gt;'yes, sir'&lt;/i&gt; before you scurry off to go cook the lunch you were late getting done for him. It should be on the table when he gets home, you know, but Mari hadn't wanted to have her nap, and that had delayed you. Luka didn't like excuses; you didn't bother telling him any of them ever again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;struck&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;came into forcible contact or collided with&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are almost seventeen and you have fallen behind in your schooling, as someone has to stay home to care for Anica now that Luka has tired of it. Luka still preaches, but all of that money is spent on alcohol and cigarettes except the little bits you steal from the coin jar and the small allowance he gives Marica, which you pool to get groceries. Usually you don't get much because Luka eats a lot and you don't want to take away from Mari or Anica's plates because Mari is still growing and Anica never did anything wrong to you besides mistake you for Dani sometimes. You don't blame her for that, though; she hasn't been there, mentally, since his death and you're pretty sure she never actually accepted that he was gone. Luka still hits you and burns you when you do something wrong (you do something wrong a lot), but you have also been target practice for a few years now and your back bears the scars of bottles that sliced open your skin. He laughs when that happens. You aren't sure how it's funny, but if you laugh too, he doesn't ask you to bring the bottles back so he can throw them again, so you learn to laugh.
              
              You aren't sure how much more of this you can take, even if you're certain you deserve most of it, and so you pack a small bag with ragged clothes that don't quite fit and a bottle of water and a box of cereal and you head out across the fields. Maybe you can find a job in the city, you figure. You just have to get there first. You've never been, but you've studied maps and you know which direction is which, so you just need to head the right way and you'll be there, eventually. You can live under a bridge or in a shelter if you find one (somewhere that someone doesn't hit you every day) and you can find a place to work and you can earn money and eventually get out of this hellhole. You aren't sure where you'll go — probably just the first place you can get to that's farther away, and the sooner the better.
              
              You don't quite make it to the city, though you come close before a storm rolls in overhead. There are no trees in sight, no shelter, and you aren't going to turn back, so you press on, at least at first. You don't have time to think about what is about to happen when a stray lightning bolt arcs down to you, the tallest thing for miles. In fact, it is so fast that you don't even see it coming. All you feel is searing pain, your muscles seizing, and your chest tightening. You try to move, to scream, to shout, to do anything, but you can't and then everything is black.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;despondent&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;in low spirits from loss of hope or courage&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are now seventeen, but barely, when you finally awake in a hospital bed. You momentarily wish that it was all a bad dream and you're still five, but the pain isn't in the right places, so you know it isn't true. This time, you are far more limited in your mobility. Your whole right shoulder and upper arm are immobilized — shattered collarbone — and your left ankle is in a cast — cracked, but not as bad as your shoulder — and beyond that, your muscles are so weak that lifting a finger feels like lifting a bag of bricks. You are later told that you were clinically dead for a minute or two, but luckily someone had been passing by and spotted you, bringing you to the hospital quickly after reviving you. You wish you hadn't survived. The darkness that you found in death was peaceful; the first time you have experienced peace in your life except when Dani was alive. Maybe it was because you were with him again, you think. You'd like that, joining him. It would be easier.
              
              You don't get many visitors as you lay in your bed, in pain and wanting it to end, but you do get one. A British professor who had been in town for work: the man who found you and saved you. He brings his son, sometimes, an energetic young man named Nigel who will eventually become your best friend, but for now, he is nothing more than a nuisance who never lets you get away with flipping off your doctors. When he catches wind of the fact that you aren't cooperative unless he's there, he is sure to be there every day and, eventually, you are actually getting better — physically and mentally. He is good for you. He makes you smile. He even makes you laugh, something you haven't done since that horseback ride before your world turned upside down. You don't tell him anything, but he seems to know that there's more to you than some &lt;i&gt;'poor, unfortunate sod'&lt;/i&gt; who got struck by lightning. Then again, you are his age and he has never seen your parents, never seen a get well card or bouquet or balloon. He gets the hint pretty fast that there isn't anyone looking out for you except you and, now, him. So the next time you wake up after he reaches this conclusion, you open your eyes to a room so full of balloons and flowers that the nurses can barely do their job. You refuse to see him for days, needing time to figure out how to say thank you, a phrase so foreign to you that you hope it's enough. He just laughs at you and your bright-red cheeks and tells you to &lt;i&gt;'get up already, it's time to try walking'&lt;/i&gt;. So you get up. You don't walk that day, but it isn't long before he's dragging you around the city anyway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;hope&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;a person or thing that may help or save someone&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are seventeen and two months when Nigel has to return to London. You are walking again and you are ready to be discharged as well, but when he asks you where his father should take you before they go to the train station, you hesitate. He doesn't even miss a beat before asking his father to buy another ticket and get a rushed passport so that you can join them. You join him in London, settled into a quaint little house where his mother teaches you alongside him and helps you catch up on your missing schoolwork. You find a way to send a letter to Marica and let her know you are in London with a friend. She says she'll miss you, but that you better have fun and bring her back a souvenir. You tell her that you will.
              
              You spend the next year traipsing around London streets, with trips to all the other little towns and various other countries that are close. You have the time of your life and you begin to think that you are free, that nothing will ever have to change and that you can be this way forever. Maybe you have finally paid your penance for killing Dani.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;fallout&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;the adverse side effects or results of a situation&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are eighteen and three months, just over a year after you followed Nigel to London, when there's a knock on the door during dinner and there is Luka, face red with anger. You don't get to say goodbye or grab your things. He grabs your arm — your right one, the one that still aches from time to time, so it hurts even more — and he drags you to the cab and to the train and back home. His hands leave marks on your skin from how tight he grips you, but you remember how this goes: don't cry, and it won't get worse.
              
              But things have changed. Now there are no rules.
              
              You wake in the morning, still on the kitchen floor where he left you, your whole body black and blue. You recognize the dull ache that changes to sharp stabbing when you breathe (broken ribs). You rub under your nose to lift off flakes of dried blood, tenderly pinching at it and thankful that it is at least not broken (or, doesn't seem to be). You slowly sit up, barely able to, but as you stand and check the clock, you see that you have thirty minutes to get his breakfast ready, and so you do. You fall into the old routine, realizing that you were never free at all and that the worst pain, out of everything you have endured, is seeing the security and hope snatched out from under you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;freedom&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You are twenty years, nine months, and three days old when you have finally saved enough from the coin jar and Mari's allowance to walk, again, to the city and catch a train to London. You show up on the Griffins' doorstep, just as bruised as the morning you woke up on the kitchen floor, tears streaming down your face, and they welcome you back with open arms. Sophie, Nigel's mother, doesn't let you out of her hug for a solid three hours, and once she does, she is in the kitchen making your favourite things and sending word to Nigel to tell him you are here. He rushes home to see you and then he does the same thing. You didn't cry when Sophie held you, but the second Nigel's arms are around your battered body, you are silently leaking tears onto his shoulder. It soaks his shirt, so he must have noticed, but he doesn't say anything. He just tells you that he'll make up the spare room for you after dinner and then tomorrow you're going to the university to register for classes — whatever you wanted to take.
              
              You are shocked when they actually allow you into the classes you request (Nigel is not). You aren't used to people wanting you, but you have never been happier in your life than you are to have the opportunity to study the sciences. You need it, at first. You've never really had stable and it feels good. But you also need a plan for what you want to do in life. The Griffins say you don't, not yet, because you didn't get to think about it before now anyway and you can't be expected to rush your decision. But you don't need to rush. You try to take your time, but you end up going with the first thing that makes your heart leap in excitement every time you step through the door of the classroom: electricity and physics.
              
              You study hard, even though it comes naturally to you and it isn't as tough as everyone says it is. You are a natural, they assure you, and they see bright things in your future. Their praise makes you glow — at first, red from embarrassment, and then later you just glow from the a big grin on your face.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;genocide&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;You never thought you'd go back home; why would you? It wasn't really home to you and it never had been. Instead, home was the small flat you shared with Nigel, that you returned to every night after helping try to encode and decode various messages for the Allied Forces during the War. You receive the letter from Marica, though, that states the Ustaše are getting restless. They were not known for kindness, especially to Serbs and other minority ethnic groups in the region, and the war had empowered them to take action. There was word they were headed to Smiljan next. You didn't wait to write her back. You just packed your things, left a note for Nigel, and caught the first train that would take you close, even if it meant risking your own life.
              
              You arrive too late. A massacre lays on the steps of your father's church and inside it. He is there, dead where he was praying, and you rush to the small farmhouse in hopes that maybe, just maybe, Anica or Marica made it out alive. You pass your sister's body on the way, but you are in shock and too numb to really recognize it. You do find Anica, huddled in the closet, shaking. She reaches out for you, calling you by your brother's name, and you scoop her up in your arms, noting how frail she has gotten, and head back the way you have come, intending to take her with you to London. There is nothing left here for either of you anymore, after all.
              
              You aren't even aware it has happened until you wake up to Anica's screams being silenced and a blood on your forehead where a bullet went in, skull still throbbing. Your fingers rise to touch the blood, staring at how they come away red but the hole is not there. You hear the cries — &lt;i&gt;'đavo, đavo!'&lt;/i&gt; — proclaiming you a devil and you realize, then, that maybe all those times you touched the blackness and came back were not truly death at all. It should have terrified you; instead, it empowered you. There were so few of the radical Croats left in the town that you didn't really dent their ranks — but you made sure those remaining did not live to tell of the death toll on your village.
              
              That said, their pleas for mercy still haunt your dreams, more than Luka ever had.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
              
              &lt;div class="h3"&gt;solitary&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div class="h6" data-size="small"&gt;existing alone; secluded or isolated&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;blockquote&gt;Your return to London is not triumphant or extraordinary. You return to the life you were living before you left, but you are quiet once more. Nigel notices the change, but nothing he does can help. Your work suffers, but you are still the brightest mind they have working there at the time, so they say nothing. You suffer through to the end of the war, but once you no longer have a job to pull you out of the apartment every day, you stop going out at all. It doesn't quite get better, so you tell Nigel you are leaving and you aren't sure when you'll be back. He makes you promise to write, clearly concerned, but lets you go.
              
              You try to find your ground again, something to stand on. You become a wandering soul, never staying in one place for too long. Europe holds no charm for you, so you go overseas in case that might prove different. It doesn't. You try new jobs, new fields of study. It doesn't help. The years pass. You and your promise are forgotten; lost to the wind, much like the innocence your mind clung to until that last day in Smiljan. You eventually return to London, more for Nigel's sake than anything, but you haven't aged since that day when you truly died and then came back to life. In comparison, he is a haggard old man. You didn't realize how long it had been, but he'd always been the understanding sort and he took to this revelation well enough. You stay with him until it is no longer feasible and people will recognize your lack of aging, and then he helps you fake your death. You live in forests and cabins and, sometimes when you need to be near the sound of a city, catacombs and tunnels beneath the main streets. Life passes you by and for the longest time, you are content to let it. This is where you remain, even after word reaches you of Nigel's death.
              
              You brush the edges of society throughout the decades. You re-join it, sometimes, but nothing ever quite sticks. You don't find something - some&lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; - to hold you to it. You change cities every couple years, for a while, too - but that doesn't work either.
              
              You miss having a home. You just don't know how to find one again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</textarea></td>

Being semi-immortal hasn't really helped much because it's given him even more time to experience these hardships. He's a sensitive soul, feeling each of these events very deeply and to extremes, despite his attempts to shove all those feelings down. He is kind, though, and unerringly so. He will attempt to aide just about anyone who needs it, even at great personal risk or cost to his own well-being. You'll find he can be quite distant at first if he doesn't know you. He is quite cautious, despite his desire to help and heal, and so will take a while to warm up, but he's trying to work on it.
              
              When it comes to interacting with people, he's particularly soft-spoken, but an otherwise excellent conversationalist (assuming you can get him to speak). He's easily distractable, often getting caught up in a flurry of his own thoughts and ideas, but trust that he hasn't missed a word you're saying either (at least, usually). He just might take a second or two to catch up and backtrack to what you were talking about first.</textarea></td>
